# 7 Series DSP48E1 Slice

This project implements the DSP48E1 slice using Verilog. The DSP48E1 slice is a versatile digital signal processing block thatcan implement custom, fully parallel algorithms.SP applications use many binary multipliers and accumulators that are best implemented in dedicated DSP slices. All 7 series FPGAs have many dedicated, full-custom, low-power DSP slices, combining high speed with small size while retaining system design flexibility.

## Key Features of DSP48E1 Slice

- **25 × 18 two’s-complement multiplier**: Power saving optional multiplier with dynamic bypass.
- **48-bit accumulator**: Can be used as a synchronous up/down counter
- **Power saving pre-adder**: Optimizes symmetrical filter applications and reduces DSP slice requirements.
- **SIMD Mode**: Single-instruction-multiple-data -> Dual 24-bit or quad 12-bit add/subtract/accumulate.
- **Optional logic unit**: Can generate any one of ten different logic functions of the two operands
- **Pattern Detector**: Provides overflow, underflow, convergent rounding, terminal count detection and auto resetting.
- **Cascading capability**: For larger multipliers and larger post-adders.
- **Pipeline Stages**: Includes multiple pipeline stages to achieve high throughput.

## Implementation Details

- **Design**: The entire DSP48E1 slice is modeled in Verilog.
- **Simulation**: The design is tested using a basic testbench on modelsim simulator to verify functionality.
- **Synthesis**: The design is synthesized using Xilinx Vivado.
- **Target**: Targeted for the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104 FPGA.
